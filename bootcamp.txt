First of all thanks to all the seniors for organising such a wonderfull bootcamp 
which not only enhanced our technical skills but also took us few steps ahead on 
spiritual path. The evening sessions were fine but i would like to add few points 
regarding afternoon sessions .The content to cover was much more than the time alloted,
still prbs tried their best but the time can be extended to cover the content more
finely rather than giving extra time for contest and assignments.
